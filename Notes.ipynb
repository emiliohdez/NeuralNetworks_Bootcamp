    "<p>Let's consider that we want to predict ($y$) if you're going to fail ($0$) and exam, or approve it ($1$). The inputs are those things that can influence the prediction, and even those that don't, like for instance:</p>\n",

    "<p>In this case, we can think that $x_1$ has an important influence on the prediction. $x_2$ and $x_3$ can help you in the exam, but are not decisive. Finally, $x_4$ is not important for the prediction. This last observation give us the notion of the importance level or <b>weight</b> of each variable.</p>\n",

    "<p>Now, we have to model an equation in order to get our probability, we can do as follow:</p>\n",

    "\t<li>$w_1 = 0.5$ can probably help.</li>\n",
    "\t<li>$w_1 = 0.2$ can help if you had a similar course.</li>\n",

    "<p>Once we get $z$, we need a function for modeling that $z$ to our final result ($y$). Like for instance: maybe our $z$ ends with a value of $2.8$ but we need a value in between $0-1$. These kind of functions are called <b>Activation Functions</b> ($f(x)$) and we can model all this system as follow:</p>\n",
